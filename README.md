# Module 3 Challenge - Random Password Generator
## Description

Cybersecurity is important but having to create a strong password on your own can be difficult and take up time from your day. By using this simple Random Password Generator (insert link to deployed site) you'll have a brand new password within seconds that will not only meet you security needs but also save you a headache.

By refactoring the provided starter code, I was able to make the site function properly and prepare for any issues it may encounter along the way (such as inaccurate password length selection). I also made small changes to the HTML & CSS to overall add to the design. Throughout this process I learned the value of:
 - Appropriately naming variables/functions
    - It's easy to get lost in your code, especailly if you have too similar of names for your content. By accurately portraying the purpose of your variable or function you are making it easier for yourself or others to read your code.
 - Layout & Single-line comments
    - During this project, I have found when I place a descriptive comments above each section it helps to organize the layout. With these labels I am able to place the sections in the order in which they should ideally be happening on the site. This makes it much easier to identify where any bugs may be or where I need to go to introduce new code. 
    - As a new developer, I'm constantly learning new vocabulary and concepts. As I went through the script.js I used single-line comments to notate definitons and/or what was being done. This makes it much easier to comprehend how the JS concepts are impacting each other while working through the code.

## Usage

The beauty of this site is it's very easy to use!

Begin by pressing 'Generate Password' which will open multiple prompt boxes at the top of the page. Follow the instructions and answer the questions based off of your passwords needs. Once you've answered every prompt, a random password will be generated in the text box. Just highlight, copy/paste, and you're good to go! For greater secutiry, it's recommended the password is stored in a safe place such as a locked passwords folder or written down on paper only you have access to. 
(See [Features](#features) below for a demonstration on how to use the *Refresh* button)

## Features

Let's say you've entered in all the needed criteria into the prompt boxes and you have a generated password sitting in the textbox... but you don't like it. That's where the *Refresh Feature* comes in handy! Go ahead and press the 'Refresh' button located next to Generate Password to have a freshly mixed batch of random characters!
